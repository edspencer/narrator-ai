# NarratorAI - AI-powered text narrations for your content

**NarratorAI** is a Node JS & React package that makes it easy to generate meta-content "narration" based on other content. It shines at reading and understanding your existing content like articles, help pages, blog posts, etc, and generating short, friendly summaries that tell the reader what content may be most useful to them.

Examples of where it can be used include:

- Text to introduce your latest content tagged with XYZ
- Text to introduce the topics most recently discussed on your blog
- "Read Next" paragraphs that link to other documents based on what the user is currently viewing

## Key Features

- **Automates tedious meta-content generation**: Uses an LLM of your choice to generate meta-content for you
- **Quick & easy Training**: CLI and UI-driven training options to rapidly align the LLM to what you want
- **Built on top of Vercel AI SDK**: Fast, flexible and extensible foundation
- **Optional React Components**: make it easy to integrate and train Narrator live in your UI

## Installation

There are 2 packages - `narrator-ai` and `@narrator-ai/react`. `narrator-ai` generates the meta-content for you, and `@narrator-ai/react` is a collection of React components that make it easy to show, regenerate and train Narrator via your UI:

```sh
npm install narrator-ai
npm install @narrator-ai/react
```
